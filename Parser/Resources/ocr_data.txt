A flagpole and a tower stands 36 meters on a horizontal plane. A person
standing successively at their bases observes that the angle of elevation of the
top of the tower is twice that of the pole. but at a point midway between their
bases the angles of elevation are complementary. Find the height of the tower?
A. 38 m C. 32 m
B. 45 m D. 27 m
A 40-m high tower stands vertically on a hillside (slapping ground) which makes
an angle of 18° with the horizontal. A tree also stands vertically up the hill from
the tower. An observer on the top of the tower ?nds the angle ofdepression of
the top of the wee to be 28° and the bottom of the tree to be 40°. Determine the
height of the tree.
A. 12.58m C. 11.35 m
B. 10.56 m D. 8.75 m
The top of a tower is sighted from point A and found to have an angle of elevation
of 26°. When sighted at point B that is 300 m closer to the tower, the angle of
elevation is 56°. Points A and B are on the same horizontal plane with the base
of the tower. What is the height of the tower? '
A. 218 m C. 175 m
B. 197 m D. 205 m
